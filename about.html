        <p>Hello, my name is Camille Gonzalez, an emerging graphic designer from St. Paul, Minnesota. My graphic design journey began in the nonprofit sector, where I was introduced to the wonderful and complex world of design. Since then, I have pursued a career in graphic design as a Master’s student at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD).</p>

        <p>As I continue my journey as a graphic designer, it becomes increasingly clear that design is one of the foundational elements of our society. Without design, there would be no cohesive visual branding, identity, or structure. Design acts as a tool for creatives to support and advance institutions. As a designer involved in the nonprofit sector, I believe it is my responsibility to stay informed and work towards creating meaningful and impactful projects.
        </p>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Portfolio Statement</h2>
        <p>After joining the Mortenson Family Foundation as the Grants and Program Coordinator, I discovered an opportunity to research and design visuals that showcase grant-making methods aimed at promoting equity and sustainability in Minnesota’s communities. As a Latina who is passionate about visual art and was raised in the very communities that MFF supports, I became eager to explore how design can contribute to supporting Latine and other BIPOC communities. To pursue this passion, I began my journey at MCAD as a Master of Arts in Graphic and Web Design student.</p>

        <p>MCAD has played a crucial role in my development as a designer, enabling me to build a portfolio that showcases my creative process, foundational design knowledge, and personal experiences. Consequently, I have begun to recognize elements of inclusion, accessibility, and cultural transparency within my work. This realization has inspired me to integrate these elements into a capstone project that highlights the history, resources, and design narratives of Latine designers. After completing my capstone and graduating from MCAD, I plan to apply what I’ve learned to achieve my professional goal of becoming an active graphic designer. I aim to use design as a tool to promote equity in various contexts.</p>
